= Public presentation (A4) <chap:pres-a4>

== Lay audience

Your A4 takes place two weeks after your A3 (Green light). This is a public session for a lay audience where you can invite family, friends, and fellow students.

Since you're presenting to a different kind of audience, you need to adapt your A3 presentation accordingly. However, your thesis remains unchanged, as your grades were already determined at A3.

The A4 may be organised for multiple students simultaneously, followed by a collective diploma ceremony (see Appendix II for the schedule).

== Quality of the lay presentation

The ability to communicate with non-specialists is explicitly listed in
the final attainment levels (see @app:final-attainment). 
Since this competence isn't evaluated elsewhere during graduation, the A4 provides an ideal
opportunity to demonstrate this skill.

Following the A4, the assessment committee will evaluate whether your lay presentation demonstrates "exceptional quality" or falls "below the expected quality" using the specific A4 rubric (see Appendix IV). 
Based on this assessment, your provisional final grade may be adjusted up or down by half a point. 
Note that this adjustment doesn't count toward the cum laude distinction (see below), and if your provisional final grade is 6.0, it cannot be lowered.

== Cum laude <cum-laude>
Based on the results gained for the courses in the Master's Programme and the final thesis, the student can be awarded a cum laude distinction. 
A student will receive this if all of the following requirements are met:

+ The weighted average of the grades of the courses, not including the graduation project, must be at least 8.0 (exemptions ("VR" in OSIRIS) will not be taken into consideration; no more than 20 ECTS may be completed with an exemption);
+ No courses may be completed after a repair resulting in a 'pass';
+ The provisional final grade of the graduation project at the A3 must be at least 8.5;
+ The study duration cannot exceed the nominal study duration plus one semester.

For students who do not meet all criteria above, especially the fourth, for instance because they were enrolled as a student in a specific semester but did not participate in any course or examination in that semester, an exemption may apply. 
This should be arranged before the A3 application date.
