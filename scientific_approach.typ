== Research project
<research-project>

The graduation project is an individual research project that is conducted by the student with guidance and regular feedback from the supervisors.

The project starts with a preliminary phase where the student lays down the foundations for their research, which includes conducting a study of the most important relevant literature, refining their topic into a specific problem statement, establishing of clear research questions or objectives, and selecting an appropriate methodology. 
This culminates into the creation of a graduation plan (see @app:deliverables), which is presented, discussed assessed at the A1 (Kick-off) meeting.

Upon approval of the graduation plan, the student conducts their research according to the methodology and time planning in it. 
The specific contents of this phase of the graduation will vary depending on the chosen methodology, but might include among others: an extended survey of scientific literature and other sources, data collection and analysis, developing new methods, tools or datasets, and software development and testing.

The main deliverable of the graduation project is a written graduation report (see @app:deliverables), which documents the research that was conducted. It includes a reflection that is integrated into the report, mostly in the introduction and conclusions. 
The contents of the report will differ depending on the nature of the research, but they should be detailed enough to allow for reproducibility of the work presented in it. Similarly, in the interest of reproducibility, if the research involved the creation of source code or data, students are highly encouraged to publish these in a persistent public repository which is linked in the report.

In addition to the graduation report, there are two other presentations as deliverables: (1) a technical presentation, which is given, discussed and assessed at the A3 (Green light) meeting, and (2) a presentation for a lay audience, which is given, discussed and assessed at the A4 (Finalisation) meeting.

== Graduation plan (A1) structure
<graduation-plan-a1-structure>

The graduation plan for A1 is a project proposal that must contain the following elements:

+ A #strong[cover page] with
  + title
  + full name
  + student number
  + names of supervisors \#1 + \#2
+ An #strong[introduction] in which the relevance of the project and its
  place in the context of geomatics is described, along with a
  clearly-defined problem statement;
+ A #strong[related work] section in which the relevant literature is
  presented and linked to the project;
+ #strong[Research questions] that are clearly defined, along with the
  scope (ie what the student will and will not be doing);
+ Overview of the proposed #strong[methodology] to be used;
+ Overview of #strong[preliminary results] (if application, discuss with
  your supervisors);
+ #strong[Time planning];—having a Gantt chart is probably a better idea
  than just a list;
+ Since specific #strong[data and tools] have to be used, it's good to
  present these concretely, so that the supervisors know that you have a
  grasp of all aspects of the project;
+ The #strong[references];.

Supervisors expect a document of 10--15 pages.

A LaTeX template is available in @app:deliverables.


== Graduation report (A3) structure
<graduation-report-a3-structure>

The exact structure of the thesis, or graduation report, will depend on the type of work that is involved. 
However, most good Geomatics theses contain something similar to the following elements:

+ Title page, possibly split into cover page, half-title, copyright page
  (with licence and names of supervisors and co-reader), etc;
+ Abstract;
+ Acknowledgements;
+ Table of contents, possibly accompanied with lists of figures, tables,
  algorithms, acronyms, etc;
+ Introduction, including motivation, research questions and a summary
  of all chapters;
+ Related work, possibly preceded by a background chapter;
+ Methodology, possibly followed by implementation and/or data chapters;
+ Results, including a critical evaluation and discussion of them;
+ Conclusions and future work.

 The implications and reflection of the work that was conducted should be integrated throughout the thesis. 
 In particular, the implications should be present in the introduction and conclusions, and the reflection should be present in the conclusions.
