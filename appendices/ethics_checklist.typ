= Data management checklist <app:ethics>

This checklist is relevant for all graduation projects at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment. 
The form is intended to highlight common aspects of graduation projects that require particular attention with regard to planning the research and data management. Relevant information and supplementary sources regarding each question are provided below each question.

With this checklist, the faculty wants to avoid that students unexpectedly find themselves in complex and stressful situations, in which ethical or privacy matters and/or other laws and regulations become an issue. In projects involving humans, certain types of data processing increase the risks to the   
human participants: planning such projects requires additional evaluations and advice from university staff before ethical approval can be received and the project can begin. In the case of a graduation   
project, obtaining additional advice or permits may delay the project with an extra education period or semester. To avoid this, it is recommended that students set up a graduation project with a low level   
of risk. Therefore, all students have to check their risk, by completing this checklist before their A1.

The first section of the checklist (A) should be completed by all students, together with their supervisor, during the planning of the graduation project, before the A1. It does not need to be submitted to anyone for review or approval. Please consider questions 1 to 3 carefully in relation to the intended graduation project, and answer with 'yes' or 'no'.

The second section of the checklist (B) should only be completed if the graduation project involves   
working with data from human participants. In that case, the student and their supervisor must apply   
for and receive ethical approval from the #link("https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics")[Human Research Ethics Committee] (HREC) before the project can begin (see the paragraph 'Explanation and follow-up' after the questions). The student   
can submit the application to the HREC, but the supervisor is responsible for making sure that the project is compliant with relevant privacy regulations and ethical policies.

*Explanation and follow-up*

If you have answered 'no' to all questions 4 to 13, your project is likely to be considered low or minimal-risk: see the paragraph 'Projects with minimal or low-risk' on the next page.

If you have answered 'yes' to one or more of the questions 4 to 13, your research likely involves extended or high risks to participants, according to the #link("https://tud365.sharepoint.com/sites/SecurityPrivacyTUD/SitePages/en/AVG-Principes.aspx")[General Data Protection Regulation] (GDPR) and TU Delft’s privacy and ethical policies: for information regarding such projects, see the paragraph 'Projects with extended or high-risk' on the next pages.

*Projects with minimal or low-risk*

If you have answered 'no' to questions 4 to 13, your project is likely
to be considered low-risk. This does not mean that the project involves
no risks at all, but suggests that these risks can likely be addressed
by the student and supervisor in the application to the
#link("https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics/hrec-approval-1-application")[Human Research Ethics Committee]
(HREC) within the timeline for a graduation project and without need for
additional support.

Compiling the HREC application: \
An application to the HREC generally involves a Data Management Plan
(DMP), a risk-identification and mitigation checklist, and informed
consent materials. Master’s students at ABE who intend to compile a HREC
application are advised to make use of the following support documents:

- the
  #link("https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/VMTCJ4RhwfpnADh")[student guide]
- the
  #link("https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/myS7ERJX7IZh57S")[Example Data Management Plan]
  for MSc projects

The graduation supervisor is
#link("https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics/hrec-approval-2-student-and-course-related-research")[responsible]
for the student’s project and ethical application, and must provide
support for compiling the HREC application documents.

Additional support \
For low-risk student graduation projects, compiling of the HREC
application documents should be done by the student in consultation with
the supervisor. The Faculty Data Steward can be contacted for individual
questions #link("mailto:datasteward-BK%40tudelft.nl?subject=")[at]
#link("mailto:datasteward-BK%40tudelft.nl?subject=")[datasteward-BK\@tudelft.nl]
however, the Data Steward does not provide detailed feedback on student
DMPs for low-risk HREC applications.

has been created to help researchers and students who work with human
participants comply with both GDPR principles and TU Delft’s policies on
Data Management and Human Research Ethics.

Timeline

Minimal or low-risk HREC applications are generally processed faster
than extended or high-risk applications (see the paragraph below).
Nevertheless, the initial evaluation by the HREC usually takes
approximately 2 weeks, and may take longer during busy periods or
holiday: see the
#link("https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics")[HREC website]
for up-to-date information. Additionally, the application may require
revisions before final approval is granted. If you do not receive an
initial response about your ethical application after 4 weeks from the
time of submission, you may follow up with the HREC to enquire about an
update.

#strong[Projects with extended or high-risk]

If you have answered 'yes' to one or more of questions 4 to 13, there
are potential increased risks related to how data from human
participants will be processed in your project. These risks will need to
be addressed in consultation with the Data Steward and other relevant
support staff before submitting the ethical application to the
#link("https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics/hrec-approval-1-application")[Human Research Ethics Committee]

support for compiling the HREC application documents.

Additional support

Once the DMP has been compiled and reviewed by the supervisor, feedback
should be requested from the Data Steward via DMPonline. After this, any
other necessary support staff will need to be contacted. Crucially, if
the project involves one or multiple ways of personal data processing
that could result in high-risk to the participants according to the
GDPR, the TU Delft Privacy Team must

be consulted to establish whether or not a
#link("https://tud365.sharepoint.com/sites/SecurityPrivacyTUD/SitePages/en/DPIA.aspx?web=1")[Data Protection Impact Assessment]
(DPIA) is required.

has been created to help researchers and students who work with human
participants comply with both GDPR principles and TU Delft’s policies on
Data Management and Human Research Ethics.

Timeline

It can take a long time to compile a complete research plan and HREC
application for projects involving extended risks. DMP feedback from the
Data Steward usually takes around 2 weeks, but can take longer during
busy periods or holidays. Receiving additional support from other staff,
such as the Privacy Team, can take anywhere from a few days to multiple
weeks, depending on the project and capacity of university staff. If a
DPIA is deemed necessary, it can take anywhere from 4 weeks to several
months.

It is important to note that advice from the Privacy Team or other
support staff, as well as any additional documents (such as necessary
contracts, or a DPIA, if needed) must be in place before the application
is submitted to the HREC. The initial evaluation by the HREC can be
processed in 2 weeks, but may take longer during busy periods or
holidays: see the
#link("https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics")[HREC website]
for up-to-date information. Additionally, the application may require
revisions before final approval is granted. If you do not receive an
initial response about your ethical application after 4 weeks from the
time of submission, you may follow up with the HREC to enquire about an
update.

Considering the limited time available for students conducting their
graduation projects, students working with data from human participants
are strongly advised to prioritise low-risk research projects. If a
student project necessitates processing data in ways that are considered
extended or high-risk, both student and supervisor need to be aware of
the extended processing times involved in obtaining ethical approval and
beginning the graduation project.
