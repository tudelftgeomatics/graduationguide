== Quorum at formal assessments
<quorum-at-formal-assessments>
A quorum is required for each assessment to be valid.

- For A1: responsible supervisor, second supervisor and delegate of the
  Board of Examiners.
- For A3: responsible supervisor, second supervisor, co-reader and
  delegate of the Board of Examiners.
- For A4: responsible supervisor and second supervisor.

In case of absence, action will be taken as follows:

- Absence of the delegate of the Board of Examiners: The Board of
  Examiners appoints the delegate of the Board of Examiners and the
  substitute delegate of the Board of Examiners for all students. If the
  delegate of the Board of Examiners cannot attend an assessment, the
  substitute will be asked and the Secretary of the Board of Examiners
  will be informed on this replacement. The substitute delegate of the
  Board of Examiners is registered in My Case.
- Absence of one of the members of the supervisory team (responsible
  supervisor, second supervisor or co-reader):
  - If it is known in advance that a supervisor or the co-reader will be
    unable to attend, a presentation must be held for that assessor
    prior to the evaluation. The assessment of that assessor must be
    written down with comments and feedback. This assessment must be
    given to the delegate of the Board of Examiners in signed letter
    within a closed envelope or sent by e-mail. At the deliberation,
    this assessment will be taken into account by the other relevant
    members of the supervisory team for determining the final
    assessment.
  - In case of an unexpected absence, the other supervisory team members
    will search for a replacement. The Secretary of the Board of
    Examiners is also informed by the responsible supervisor or the
    delegate of the Board of Examiners about this absence. The
    assessment should preferably be continued, but the final assessment
    should be determined after hearing the absent supervisor. The
    determination for a 'go' or 'no go' at A1 or A3, including the
    registration of the grades on the list at A3 can only take place
    after consulting the absent assessor. If this is not possible, the
    final assessment is postponed. In both cases, a meeting with the
    absent supervisor takes place on the shortest possible term, to
    determine a final conclusion. In case of doubt or on request of the
    student, it may be decided that an extra assessment must be held.

== Difficulties at the deliberation
<difficulties-at-the-deliberation>
It may occur that the deliberation does not lead to an unambiguous
assessment. The delegate of the Board of Examiners informs the student
on this situation and explains the applied procedure and the
corresponding terms. Subsequently, the presented products will be handed
over to the Secretary of the Board of Examiners. The Secretary of the
Board of Examiners decides which member of the committee will look after
this matter. This member of the Board of Examiners will reconvene the
supervisory team and the delegate of the Board of Examiners for a
redeliberation, chaired by the member of the Board of Examiners, in
which an attempt is made to reach consensus. If unexpectedly this does
not succeed, the member of the Board of Examiners will make a final
decision.

== Plagiarism
<plagiarism>
The plagiarism scan on graduation documents is implemented for all
graduating students, to guarantee the authenticity of the graduation
work. For this, the Turnitin tool in Brightspace is used. The tool will
make it easier for the student and supervisors to check the work of a
student on originality and plagiarism. The supervisors and delegates
will be enrolled by Education and Student Affairs in the Plagiarism
Brightspace course. The student has the possibility to upload
provisional versions of their document as often as desired for
plagiarism feedback, only meant for the student. The final version of
the Graduation Report for the A3 will be submitted in the final version
folder of the plagiarism scan, at the latest one week before the A3. The
final submission folder will only allow one submission for each student
and the plagiarism feedback will only be visible for the supervisors. It
is the responsibility of the responsible supervisor to determine whether
the results of the plagiarism scan in the final folder are an indication
of actual plagiarism. In all cases, suspicion of plagiarism or not, the
responsible supervisor should share the findings with the student, the
second supervisor, the co-reader and the delegate at the A3. If there is
a suspicion of intentional plagiarism, the responsible supervisor should
discuss this with the student and notify the Board of Examiners
afterwards.
