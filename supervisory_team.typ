= Supervisory team <chap:supervisory-team>

At the start of the graduation process, the student's supervisory team
is defined. This team is composed of two supervisors and a co-reader.
The supervisors guide the student during the graduation process and are
responsible for assessing the student's work and progress at the A1
(Kick-off) and A2 (Midterm). Together with the co-reader, who serves as
an independent expert, they also assess and determine the grades at the
A3 (Green light), which are only disclosed at the A4 (Green light), as
seen in Chapter 4.

== Supervisors
<supervisors>
The responsible supervisor (also called first or main supervisor) is an
expert in the graduation project field and must be a scientific staff
member (including PhD students and postdocs) from the groups involved in
MSc Geomatics education: 3D geoinformation, GIS technology (GDMC), or
the Knowledge center open data. Students choose this supervisor during
the A0 (Registration) phase, either by directly contacting them to agree
on a custom topic or by selecting a predefined topic linked to the
supervisor.

The second supervisor is a scientific staff member from TU Delft whose
expertise complements that of the responsible supervisor. She/he may be
predefined based on the selected topic or chosen by the responsible
supervisor with student input. If the responsible supervisor doesn't
hold a PhD degree, the second supervisor must have one. Ideally, the
second supervisor is determined at the A0 (Registration) phase and must
be confirmed before the A1 (Kick-off).

== Co-reader
<co-reader>
The co-reader is a scientific staff member of TU Delft or another
university who is an expert in the field of the graduation project.
Their role is to assess the quality of the student's work in an unbiased
way at the A3 (Green light). Preferably, they are not part of the same
group(s) as the supervisors. The co-reader is chosen by the supervisors
in collaboration with the student. The co-reader is preferably defined
at the A0 (Preparation) and must be defined before the A3 (Green light).

== Delegate of the Board of Examiners
<delegate-of-the-board-of-examiners>
Since the Board of Examiners is responsible for guarding the quality of
all examinations, a delegate is appointed by the administration of the
Faculty before the A1: a (former) teacher who is familiar with the
graduation process and who is not from the same section as your
supervisors; this to assure independency. The delegate functions
independently from the supervisors and student, and chairs the A1
(Kick-off) and A3 (Green light). In that capacity, the delegate is there
to protect the student against process errors and possibly unfair
treatment by the supervisors, while on the other hand ensuring that the
student is assessed according to the appropriate criteria by the
supervisors (see Chapter 4).
