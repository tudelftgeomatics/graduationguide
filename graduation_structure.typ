= Graduation structure <chap:graduation-structure>

== Duration <duration>
The #emph[Geomatics Graduation Studio] (the graduation phase where the MSc thesis is written; GEO2021) is 40ECTS and lasts in general three quarters.

It normally takes place during the last three quarters of the second Master's year (quarters Q6+Q7+Q8), but it can be started in any calendar quarter.
//-- TODO: no start every quarter?

== Structure <structure>

== Admission and assessments <admission-and-assessments>
To enter the graduation phase (at A1), the student must have obtained 55 ECTS from the first Master's year programme, and have followed the Q5 electives of 15 ECTS (see image structure above).

The graduation phase is divided into the following assessments:

    columns: 3,

    thesis topic, either by picking from a topic from
    #link("https://geomatics.bk.tudelft.nl/geo2021/potentialtopics/")[the list]
    or by agreeing on a custom topic.],
    [A1], [Kick-off], [Formal 'go/no go' assessment of the graduation
    plan, 15 min presentation and discussion.],
    [A2], [Midterm], [A structured meeting with both supervisors to
    discuss progress and updated plans. The form is decided by the
    supervisors.],
    [A3], [Green light], [Formal final assessment of the complete
    graduation report (MSc thesis), presentation of \~20min, and
    discussion.],
    [A4], [Finalisation], [Presentation for a lay audience.],
  )
)

== Calendar <calendar>
All assessments (except A2) should be held in the weeks indicated below.
Please be aware that there are deadlines for the registration for each
assessment. For the academic year 2025-2026, this implies the following
weeks and deadlines, as registered in the BK academic graduation
calendar:

#figure(image("figs/calendar.png"))

== Retakes <retakes>
All formal #emph[As] are offered in every quarter.

At the A1 (Kick-off), the supervisors with the delegate determine whether the student's plan and presentation meet the requirements, resulting in a 'go' to the A2 (Midterm) phase. 
If a 'no-go' is given, the A1 can be done again in the next quarter.

The same applies to the A3 (Green light), where the supervisors, co-reader, and the delegate give a 'go' to proceed to the public A4 (Finalisation) two weeks later (the grades are also determined but not yet communicated); if the requirements are not met, the consequent 'no go' results in a retake of the A3 in the next quarter.

== Registration <registration>
For planning purposes, the faculty is using the #emph[SuperSaaS] tool, which can be accessed by the student's supervisors. 
It is the responsibility of the responsible supervisor to register the student's A1, A3 and A4 applications before the deadlines in the BK academic graduation calendar. 
This makes it possible to have a room for the assessment, as well as for your supervisors, co-reader and delegate to record a timely reservation in their agenda. 
If dates need to be changed, or if dates in SuperSaaS are not available for the quarter, this should be resolved within the supervisory team and communicated to Education and Student Affairs (E&SA) (#link("mailto:graduation-bk@tudelft.nl")[graduation-bk\@tudelft.nl]).

For registering the graduation process, the faculty is using the #emph[MyCase] registration tool (see @app:mycase[Appendix]). 
It is the student's task to start their own 'graduation case'. 
MyCase is used for the registration of assessment dates, submission of the deliverables before an assessment, registration of the assessments, and feedback. 
Moreover, the names of the supervisors, co-reader and delegate, and the progress and assessment results are registered in this application. After each assessment, the responsible supervisor fills in the assessment (see @chap:feedback and @app:rubrics[Appendix]).

== Ethics <ethics>
In projects involving humans, certain types of data processing increase the risks to the human participants: planning such projects requires additional evaluations and advice from university staff before ethical approval can be received and the project can begin. 
In the case of a graduation project, obtaining additional advice or permits may delay the project with an extra semester. 
Therefore, all students have to check their risk, by completing the Ethics Checklist (@app:ethics[Appendix]) before the A1. 
Only if the graduation project involves working with data from human participants, should the rest of the checklist be completed and contact be made with the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC).
