The graduation phase is the last step in the MSc Geomatics programme. 
It is completed in the form of an individual research project.

The topic of the scientific project can be related to any of the subjects offered by the MSc Geomatics programme.

The project can be performed in cooperation with a company/institution, which provides a use case or a problem statement (but the work is always supervised by the scientific staff of the university).

More information, news, updates, downloaded templates, and a calendar can be found on the official website: #link("https://geomatics.bk.tudelft.nl/geo2021/")
