= Feedback and assessment <chap:feedback>

Throughout the graduation phase, the student should receive regular
feedback from the supervisory team. More extensive feedback is provided
during the A1, A2 and A3 assessments.

One week before the A1 and A3 assessments, the student submits the main
deliverables (graduation plan for A1 and graduation report for A3).
These are presented at the A1 and A3 assessment sessions, where the
independent delegate chairs the session. Following the presentation, the
student responds to the supervisory team's questions. Then, the
supervisory team and delegate retreat for deliberation, after which the
results are announced and feedback is provided.

During the A2 assessment, the supervisors and student conduct a more
structured meeting to discuss the progress and (updated) plans. The form
of this session depends on the supervisors, but it might include a
presentation, demo or extended discussion session.

At the A1 and A3, the result is formally expressed in a 'go' or a 'no
go'. In case of a 'no go', a retake of the assessment can take place in
the next education period (see @chap:graduation-structure and @app:assessments[Appendix]). At the A3,
the 'go' or 'no go' determines both whether the student continues to the
A4 and the grades, which will not yet be disclosed (see below).

== Components of assessments <components-of-assessments>
For the A1 and A2, it is being assessed whether the work is quantitatively and qualitatively on schedule with respect to the A3.

== Deliberation and feedback <deliberation-and-feedback>
After the A1 and A3 presentations and subsequent discussion, the supervisory team will retreat for deliberation. 
At the A1 and A3, the independent delegate chairs the deliberation (see @chap:supervision and @app:assessments[Appendix]), without influencing the result.

During the deliberation, the supervisory team assesses the deliverables, including the presentation and the answers to the supervisory team's questions. 
This assessment is formally expressed in a 'go' or a 'no go', representing a 'sufficient to good' or 'insufficient' level respectively.

At end of the deliberation for the A1 and A3, the responsible supervisor
should communicate the results of the deliberation ('go' or 'no go') and
provide feedback to the student, including how to improve. At the A2,
there might not be a deliberation, but the supervisors should still
provide feedback to the student. Afterwards, the responsible supervisor
should register this result and feedback in MyCase.

== Grades
<grades>
The grades that are determined at the A3 are provisional will not yet be
announced during the A3. Two weeks later, at the public A4, the final
grade list will be presented, but not publicly disclosed, to the student
together with the diploma. In exceptional cases, based on the quality of
the lay presentation, the preliminary final grade can be increased or
lowered by half a point by the supervisory team (see Chapter 5).
